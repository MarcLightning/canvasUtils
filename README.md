# canvasUtils
A small set of scripts that interface with the Canvas REST API (or similar REST API) without needing curl.

The scripts reference a constant named TOKEN (this should be your auth token you've generated in Canvas (or for a similar REST API). Be sure to set one up before using the scripts otherwise nothing will work!
